# GG [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

*GG* speeds up the creation of those pesky single commit merge requests by combining several (Git) commands into one.

Written example:

```bash
âžœ gg feature/typo-in-readme "Fix a typo in the README.md"
```

# Notice

It currently only works for Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket merge requests (or pull requests depending on the platform).

## How it works

*GG* combines multiple (Git) commands for you, for faster and easier single commit merge requests.

1. `git checkout` First it creates a new branch with the provided name;
2. `git commit` Then it creates the commit with the provided commit message;
3. `git push` After that it pushes to the created branch;
4. `open` Then it looks for the url used for creating a new merge request in the response of the git push command and opens that page in your browser;
5. `git checkout` Finally it does a checkout back to the repository you started from;
